BIOINFO VS COMP BIOINFO
    bioinfo
        algorithm
        creation of tools
        engineering
        build useful tools
    compbio
        study of bio via compute

    Levels:
        [0] modeling for modeling sake
        [1] entry : use of published tools, generate hypothesis for experiments
        [2] bioinfo: algorithms
        [3] compbio: biodiscovery from public data integration and modeling
        [X] integrative studies from big consortia

    1 vs 2
        1 - only help collaborators
        2 - many/public groups can use for algorithms
        3 - front-seat

    interdisciplinary (change in emphasis over time)
        stats:      numbers
        compsci:    sequence
        biology:    question

    applied:
        from freshman to postdocs

    moves w/ tech development
        removing microarray and adding scATAC (single-cell)ATAC sequence
Is this class for me?
