PROTEIN STRUCTURE WAVE
    1955 Bovine insulin Sanger

    Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (can either align exact seq, or similar seq)

    Protein data bank

    BLAST (basic local alignment sequence)

    CASP (for protein structures) (critical assessment of structural prediction)

    BLOCKS database

    CASP9 (2012)
        HHpred
        Rosetta
        All algorithm

    Structure solver
        DeepMind AlphaFold2 (CASP14 protein-folding contest)
GENE EXPRESSION WAVE 
    northern blot - expression of single gene

    microarray - hundreds to millions of tiny probes (measure many gene in a condition )

    gene expression 

    distinguish ALL vs alignment (Gene CHIP) Golub et. al Science 1999

    use of microarray RASL-sesq/ Luminex.,. profile of 1K genes at 5$ per sample

    Broad Institute --> Connectivity Map Project using Luminex...
    profile 1M profile from perturbations(deviation of a system) of multiple cell types

    single-cell gene expression techniques

    scRNA-seq.. determine cell types within a set of tissues (Cao et al, Science 2020)
        developed... sci-RNA-seq (split-pool approach)
                    able to sequence >4M single-cells
                    then, cluster the cells accordingly
GENOME SEQUENCING WAVE
    DNA structure (Watson and Crick, double-helix)
    Recombinant DNA
    Sanger sequencing
    PCR 
    NCBI
    BLAST

    Human Genome Race

    Clone-by-clone(public) (chapter-by-chapter)
    sequence-overlaps can determine the order ---> contig's ---> stitched to create complete sequence


    Whole-Genome shotgun (private)
    generate tens of millions of sequence reads
    computational approaches.. assemble into contigs then whole chromosomes seqs

    complete human genome in 2003
