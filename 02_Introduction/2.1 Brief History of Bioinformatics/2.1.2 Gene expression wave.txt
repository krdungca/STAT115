northern blot - expression of single gene

microarray - hundreds to millions of tiny probes (measure many gene in a condition )

gene expression 

distinguish ALL vs alignment (Gene CHIP) Golub et. al Science 1999

use of microarray RASL-sesq/ Luminex.,. profile of 1K genes at 5$ per sample

Broad Institute --> Connectivity Map Project using Luminex...
profile 1M profile from perturbations(deviation of a system) of multiple cell types

single-cell gene expression techniques

scRNA-seq.. determine cell types within a set of tissues (Cao et al, Science 2020)
    developed... sci-RNA-seq (split-pool approach)
                able to sequence >4M single-cells
                then, cluster the cells accordingly
